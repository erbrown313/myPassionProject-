<h1> My Greatest Passion: Literature</h1>
<h3> Eric Brown Adult Cohort Spring 23'</h3>

<p> Reading has been one of my biggest passions for about as long as I can remember. Growing up as a child, reading gave me the opportunity to explore the farthest boundaries of my imagination. During times of stress or sadness, I could always open up a book and escape for as long as I needed. I was always naturally curious, and the fact that there was a medium that could afford me opportunities to not only learn but explore, is something I have cherished since I discovered it. I gravitated to books on science and history, but as I grew, my interests expanded into philosophy and science fiction. The television started to bore me, the world building wasn't as gripping, and the ideas and scenes didn't have the same room to breathe.</p>

<p>I was introduced to Literature in my early adolesence by my Mother and Grandmother, they wanted to challnge me to expand the boundaries of my imagination while also affording me an academic advantage.</p>

<p>My biggest literary inspirations are Dan Abnett and my uncle Ray who is also a published author. Abnett inspiring me by excelling at writing subjets he is passionate about. My uncle inspires me by showing me that being deliberate, and staying true to your talents can produce concrete results</p>

<p>Marcus Aurellius inspires me by showcasing that writing can be timeless, sun tzu in showing that writings can be prophetic on a scale that we could never fathom within our individual lifetimes
